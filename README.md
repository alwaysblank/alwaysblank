### Hi Friends

I build web sites for [Murmur Creative](https://github.com/murmurcreative), a branding, packaging, and web agency (and a certified B-corp), 
and I [help out users](https://discourse.roots.io/) of the Roots stack as part of the [Roots team](https://github.com/roots) (and occasionally contribute code).

When I'm not doing those things, I enjoy 

- 📷 [amateur photography](https://photos.alwaysblank.org) 
- ☕ [coffee](https://www.nossacoffee.com/)
- 🐕 hanging out with my dogs
