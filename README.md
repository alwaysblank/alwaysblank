## Hi Folks

I'm a software engineer and a taco enthusiast. I like writing code and documentation. Additionally I'm a big fan of natural fibers (for my clothing, but beans are nice too).

When I'm not doing those things, I enjoy

### Things I've Built

Perhaps you'll find some of them useful!
Perhaps not.
But here they are anyway.

- **[brief](https://github.com/alwaysblank/brief)** - Useful for handling collections of data where you need to gracefully handle non-existence of individual items.
    More useful than an array, less useful (but also lighter) than Laravel Collections.
- **[drawer](https://github.com/alwaysblank/drawer)** - Drawer was originally created to handle opening and closing website navigation menus. It still does this very well! But you can use it to do other things too. Simple framework-agnostic JS state management library, built around modifying HTML data attributes for easy CSS integration.
- **plumbing** - These are several different tiny packages I made to help with small tasks in WordPress that I kept "solving".
    - [normalize-links](https://github.com/alwaysblank/plumbing-normalize-links) - Makes it a bit easier to use and interact with the arrays returns by ACF's "link" field type.
    - [templates](https://github.com/alwaysblank/plumbing-templates) - Allows you to set specific directories for custom templates for pages (and custom post types) in WordPress. 
    - [responsive-images](https://github.com/alwaysblank/plumbing-responsive-images) - Wrapper for handling generating responsive images when using WordPress.
    - [acf](https://github.com/alwaysblank/plumbing-acf) - Slim interface over ACF's `get_field()` that mostly just adds the ability to get several fields at once--and the ability to provide defaults and run callbacks on those fields individually.
